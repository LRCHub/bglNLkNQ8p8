Your life is gone
Your youth is over
Years of cheer
Reduced to this
A crumbling mess
On a September morn
Your blood flows by
Like a meandering stream
Bubbling
Gurgling
Brook-like
Baking in the midday sun
Hard on the outside
Soft on the inside
(That's a nice contract)
I saw you there
Sioux City bound
In a cornfield
I saw you there
Stinking
