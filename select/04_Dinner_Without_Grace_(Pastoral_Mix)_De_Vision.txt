Immaculation in your eyes
Depravity within your mind
A suffer from a devotional alliance
Purity is in your smile
A lack of confidence beneath your shine
Another heavenly defiance

They're telling you lies
Privation within their rhymes
Don't wait for god's embrace
Let's have a dinner without grace
They're telling you lies
Deceit is in their mind
It's time that in God's face
We have a dinner without grace

Morality will fall apart
A greater scheme deep in your heart
No time for innocence and pride
Sincerity you have to prove
Dissimulation is too close to truth
Don't mind their chastity tonight

They're telling you lies...
