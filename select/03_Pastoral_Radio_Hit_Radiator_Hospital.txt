I don't know your face
Don't know your kind
But I've been feeling like I
Know your every thought
Your every crime
And I don't want to lose it

I don't know how
But my big cloud is lifting now

Sleeping in the van
I understand that I
Just might be dreaming
But now my stupid jokes
My fibs and lies
Are someone else's feelings

You fade in and out
With each new street we turn down

I've been in your head, been on your mind
End up in your bedroom half the time
Feeling like I'm a part of your life
Losing you when I open my eyes

Up on Primrose Hill we got so high
I've been feeling very, very nice
When I've been in your head, been on your mind
Yeah, I've been in your head, been on your mind
